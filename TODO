write_style_xml:
  * Extract this method into it own class Style
  * Extract all the persistace logic into another class which knows how to turn a style object to xml
  * A style should have all it properties
  * This method takes a file parameter to know if its writing to content.xml or styles.xml.
    Content.xml and styles.xml should be intances of the same class which would remove the ambiguity.

class Table:
  get_table_width:
    * The name of this method sugest there should be a class named Table with an attribute width.
  rename_table:
    * The name of this method sugest there should be a class named Table with a method rename or an attribute 
      name that can be set.

insert_table: 
  * For once a method is sort of where it should be but it does too much.
  * Creating a Table should not be here.
  * Creating Xml Nodes for an empty table shouldn't be here.
  * Mixes persistance with busness logic

class Formula:
  * From the README a formula seem like a good candidate for a class

class Row:
  * There are a lot of methods working with rows which have cells and persisting them

class Cell
  * This class should come in many types, based on the type of content it will store.
